# TravelScott
This project was built for my school's major assignment, using the MERN stack. The primary objective was to create a fully functional booking/travel website featuring a visually appealing and distinctive UI/UX design. The project was still missing some features, but it reached my assignment goal. As I was not entirely satisfied, I'll make a brand new enhanced version of it in the future.

**Quick start**:
1. Clone the repository
2. `npm install`
3. Test the project (note that tours may not be displayed because this website is not hosted and currently using my MongoDB database)
`cd ./backend` - `npm run start-dev`
`cd ./frontend` - `npm start`
