# TravelScott
This school project was crafted using the robust MERN stack, incorporating MongoDB, ExpressJs, ReactJs, and NodeJs. The primary objective was to create a fully functional travel website featuring a visually appealing and distinctive UI/UX design. As of November 24, 2023, the project had reached an impressive 80% completion milestone. Future plans involve enhancing its capabilities by integrating a Decision Support System (DSS) function, designed to function as an AI assistant, providing valuable travel suggestions and further augmenting the overall user experience. Stay tuned for the upcoming upgrades!
