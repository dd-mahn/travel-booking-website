# TravelScott
This is my school project which was built with MERN stack(MongoDB - ExpressJs - ReactJs - NodeJs). The purpose is to develop a fully functional travel website with nice and unique UI/UX. Until 24/11/2023. this project was 80% completed. Soon I will upgrade it with a DSS function(act like an AI assistant) for traveling suggestions.

How to test:
/frontend: `npm start`
/backend: `npm run start-dev`
